Urban sensing as a random search: the taxi-drive process

%Random search processes are well studied
Random search processes are a well studied topic that have been applied in diverse contexts. Examples include the spreading of diseases and rumours \cite{}, gene transcription, animal forgaing \cite{}, immune systems chasing pathogens \cite{}, robotic exploration, and transport in disordered media \cite{}. Early research on random search process focused on the simple, symmetric random walk in Euclidean spaces. As the field developed however, many variants have been considered, such as persistent randomn walk, intermittent random walks, and Levy flights / walks, which have advantageous spreading properties in certain contexts. Topologies other that Euclidean spaces, such as random graphs, and complex networks from the real world, have also been studied \cite{} 


%Taxi-drive = new. Where it came from
In this work, we explore a new random search process: \textit{the taxi drive}. As the name suggests, this process models the movement of taxis. The motivation for studying such a process comes from an recent (theoretical) work in urban sensing \cite{}, in which sensors are deployed on taxis, thereby allowing air pollution, road congestion, and other urban phenomena to be monitored 'parasitically' as the taxis drive around serving passengers. As such, this drive-by approach to urban sensing can be viewed as a random search problem, in which a city's street segments becomes 'sensed' as they are traversed by sensor-bearing taxis.  


%Define the taxi drive
Similar to Levy walks or the run-and-tumble motion of bacteria, the movements of taxis have both regular and random parts: passenger destinations are chosen randomly, but the routes taken to those destinates are (approximately) deterministic. This mix of ballistic and random motion makes spreading properties of taxis unusual; as shown in \cite{}, the stationary distribution of the taxi-drive process on real-world street networks obey Zipf's law, in agreement with large, real-world taxi data from nine cities worldwide. The behavior contrats sharply with that that of the random walk, whose stationary ditribution on the same street networks are skewed and unimodal (see Figure X in \cite{}). The purpose of the present work is to examine if other aspects of the taxi drive process are also atypical. To this end, we do X. We find Y.

#Discussion
The cross-disciplinary use of tools from probability theory and related fields has a long history, seen in biology, physics, computer science, and engineering. By analogizing urban sensing as a random search problem, our work continues this interdisciplinary tradition. We hope it stimulates further theoretical interest in urban sensing, and leads to more interaction between traditional research areas and the growing field of city science.
